# Lending Club Case Study
> In this case study, using the techniques in EDA, one should gain knowledge of risk analytics in banking and 
financial services.


## Table of Contents
#### In this case study we will understand how data is used to,
* To identify these risky loan applicants
* To minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
* To understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are 
strong indicators of default.
* To identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions 
such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest 
rate, etc(#general-information)
(#technologies-used)
* Python 3 




## General Information
A consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

* If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

* If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company



## Conclusions
#### The analysis in the case study with respect to the charged off loans. There is a more probability of defaulting when :
* Applicants taking loan for 'home improvement' and have income of 60k -70k
* Applicants whose home ownership is 'MORTGAGE and have income of 60-70k
* Applicants who receive interest at the rate of 21-24% and have an income of 70k-80k
* Applicants who have taken a loan in the range 30k - 35k and are charged interest rate of 15-17.5 %
* Applicants who have taken a loan for small business and the loan amount is greater than 14k
* Applicants whose home ownership is 'MORTGAGE and have loan of 14-16k
* When grade is F and loan amount is between 15k-20k
* When employment length is 10yrs and loan amount is 12k-14k
* When the loan is verified and loan amount is above 16k
* For grade G and interest rate above 20%
